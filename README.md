#Scopify

These steps will allow a Raspberry Pi of nearly any form to become a WiFi->Serial Bridge. The main purpose of this code is to enable telescopes to be controlled wirelessly from a phone, tablet, or computer. The capability of a WiFi bridge is certainly useful in other fields but that is not the main goal of this project.

In the instructions files, I will go into the maximum detail that I think someone who has a Raspberry Pi will need. This means that I won't spoon feed, but I will give every step required. If you think I should add or subtract, please leave a comment in the discussion board.
