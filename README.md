#Scopify

These steps will allow a Raspberry Pi of nearly any form to become a WiFi->Serial Bridge. The main purpose of this code is to enable telescopes to be controlled wirelessly from a phone, tablet, or computer. The capability of a WiFi bridge is certainly useful in other fields but that is not the main goal of this project.

There are many ways that I will talk about to make a WiFi to Serial Bridge. Raspberry Pi being the most popular will come first. The instructions should work on all flavors of the Pi. I'm doing all my development work on the RPi Zero, A+, B+, and 2.

Future instructions will cover the NTC C.H.I.P. (awesome little device), and the ESP8266 modules. 

In the instructions files, I will go into the maximum detail that I think someone who has a Raspberry Pi will need. This means that I won't spoon feed, but I will give every step required. If you think I should add or subtract, please leave a comment in the discussion board.
